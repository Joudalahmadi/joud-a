# Bikeshare Project


This project analyzes bikeshare data to provide insights into bike usage patterns in different cities. The code has been refactored to improve efficiency and readability.

# description

The bikeshare project is a Python program that allows users to explore and analyze bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The program provides valuable insights into bike usage patterns, popular stations, and trip durations.

By running the bikeshare program, users can interactively explore the data and answer interesting questions about bike sharing in each city. The program prompts users to select a city and specify optional filters for month and day. Based on the user's input, the program calculates and displays various statistics and visualizations.

Key features of the bikeshare project include:

- Interactive user interface: The program guides users through the data exploration process, allowing them to select a city and apply filters to analyze specific time periods.

- Data exploration: Users can view statistical summaries, such as the most common start and end stations, the most common trip duration, and the total travel time.

- Time-based filtering: Users can filter the data by month and/or day to analyze bikeshare patterns for specific time periods.

- Visualizations: The program generates visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, to help users visualize the data and gain insights.

The bikeshare project provides a hands-on opportunity to apply Python programming skills and gain experience in data analysis. By exploring real-world bikeshare data, users can uncover interesting trends and patterns, contributing to a better understanding of urban transportation.

## Features

- Load and preprocess bikeshare data
- Filter data based on user input for city, month, and day
- Calculate statistics such as total trips and average trip duration
- Display results in a user-friendly format

## Refactoring Changes

During the refactoring process, the following improvements were made:

- Optimized data loading and preprocessing for faster execution
- Streamlined the filtering process to enhance user experience
- Improved variable naming and code readability
- Implemented modular functions for better code organization
